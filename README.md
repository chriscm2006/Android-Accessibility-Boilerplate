# Android-Accessibility-Boilerplate
Basic Android AccessibilityService boilerplate starter project.

There is a lot of frustrating boilerplate code related to accessibility services that 
Android Studio does not have default project configurations for.  This repo is a good 
default starting point for development of any accessiblity service.  

I will attempt to add comments to configuration points that people have problems with
and am open to comments/suggestions on using this repository to make accessibility
service code less confusing!
